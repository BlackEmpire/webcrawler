 Version: 0.2
 
WebCrawler written in C. This program should be cross-platform, I've only tested it on Linux x86.
This web crawler don't support https.

If you don't want use a proxy set the proxy ip and proxy port to 0 (see later).

The last option if set to 'y' will write results on output.txt in the same folder.

Attention: The program is an alpha version (i.e. is instable). You can help me reporting crash, thanks.

Compile:
$ gcc -o webcrawler webcrawler.c http.c

Usage:
$ ../webcrawler HTTP_TYPE start_page ip port host-name user-agent cookies proxy_ip proxy_port write_file

Example:
$ ../webcrawler GET /index.php 111.222.333.444 80 www.domain.com Firefox cookie_key=null_value 0 0 y


 
CHANGELOG:

v0.2
	- Added support to http proxies for http tunneling.
